New Preprint Available: **Blockwise Missingness meets AI** [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24158">Arxiv</a>]. Our new work tackles a long-standing challenge in statistics: semiparametric inference for data with non-monotone missing patterns. For over 30 years, the theoretically optimal estimator has been known but considered computationally intractable for practical use. We introduce an elegant **RAY approximation** to the optimal estimating equation, striking a crucial balance between statistical efficiency and computational feasibility. This approach can be seamlessly integrated into both classical semiparametric and modern prediction-powered inference frameworks, offering a powerful new tool for researchers.
