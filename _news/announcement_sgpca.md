New Preprint Available: **sparse group principal component analysis** [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04178">Arxiv</a>]. This work proposes an efficient iterative algorithm with double thresholding steps to estimate principal components where data is collected from multi-view, especially multi-cell type in gene expression data.
