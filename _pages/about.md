<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/statistics-datascience/index.html">Department of Statistics & Data Science</a> at Carnegie Mellon University, working with <a href="https://kathrynmroeder.github.io">Kathryn Roeder</a> and <a href="https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~jinglei/">Jing Lei</a>. 

Previously, I obtained my PhD degree from <a href="https://www.stat.uci.edu">University of California, Irvine</a>, under supervision of <a href="https://qu.pstat.ucsb.edu">Annie Qu</a>.
